# Tindog (with Bootstraps)

This is an exercise project from the Udemy's WebDev Bootcamp course, specifically the Bootstraps section. The goal was to design professionally looking front'end of a Tinder look-alike targeting dogs.

The project was not altered in any way and was used to learn Bootstraps as well as professional web design.
